## Upgrading to Dapr 1.0.0

To upgrade to this release of Dapr, follow the steps here to ensure a smooth upgrade. You know, the one where you don't get red errors on the terminal.. we all hate that, right?

### Local Machine / Self-hosted

Uninstall Dapr using the CLI you currently have installed. Note that this will remove the default $HOME/.dapr directory, binaries and all containers dapr_redis, dapr_placement and dapr_zipkin. Linux users need to run sudo if docker command needs sudo:

```bash
dapr uninstall --all
```

Next, follow [these](https://github.com/dapr/cli#installing-dapr-cli) instructions to install the latest CLI version, or alternatively download the latest and greatest release from [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli/releases) and put the `dapr` binary in your PATH.

Once you have installed the CLI, run:

```bash
dapr init
```

Wait for the update to finish,  ensure you are using the latest version of Dapr(1.0.0) with:

```bash
$ dapr --version

CLI version: 1.0.0
Runtime version: 1.0.0
```

### Kubernetes

#### Upgrading from previous version

If you previously installed Dapr using Helm, you can upgrade Dapr to a new version.
If you installed Dapr using the CLI, go [here](#starting-fresh-install-on-a-cluster).

##### 1. Get the latest CLI

Get the latest version of the Dapr CLI as outlined above, and put it in your path.
You can also use the helper scripts outlined [here](https://github.com/dapr/cli#installing-dapr-cli) to get the latest version.

##### 2. Upgrade existing cluster

First, add new Dapr helm repository(see [breaking changes](#breaking-changes)) and update your Helm repos:

```bash
helm repo add dapr https://dapr.github.io/helm-charts/ --force-update
helm repo update
```

Run the following commands to upgrade the Dapr control plane system services and data plane services:

* Export certificates

  ```
  dapr mtls export -o ./certs
  ```

* Updating Dapr control plane pods
  * Using the certs exported above, run the following command:
    ```
    helm upgrade dapr dapr/dapr --version 1.0.0 --namespace dapr-system --reset-values --set-file dapr_sentry.tls.root.certPEM=./certs/ca.crt --set-file dapr_sentry.tls.issuer.certPEM=./certs/issuer.crt --set-file dapr_sentry.tls.issuer.keyPEM=./certs/issuer.key
    ```

  * Wait until all the pods are in Running state:

    ```
    kubectl get pods -w -n dapr-system
    ```

  * Verify the control plane is updated and healthy:

    ```
    $ dapr status -k

    NAME                   NAMESPACE    HEALTHY  STATUS   REPLICAS  VERSION  AGE  CREATED
    dapr-dashboard         dapr-system  True     Running  1         0.5.0    15s  2020-12-15 13:07.39
    dapr-sidecar-injector  dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.0.0   15s  2020-12-15 13:07.39
    dapr-sentry            dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.0.0   15s  2020-12-15 13:07.39
    dapr-operator          dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.0.0   15s  2020-12-15 13:07.39
    dapr-placement         dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.0.0   15s  2020-12-15 13:07.39
    ```

* Updating the data plane (sidecars)
  * Next, issue a rolling update to your Dapr enabled deployments. When the pods restart, the new Dapr sidecar version will be picked up.

    ```
    kubectl rollout restart deploy/<DEPLOYMENT-NAME>
    ```

All done!

#### Starting fresh install on a cluster 

If you previously installed Dapr on your Kubernetes cluster using the Dapr CLI, run:

*Note: Make sure you're uninstalling with your existing CLI version*

```bash
dapr uninstall --kubernetes
```

It's fine to ignore any errors that might show up.

If you previously installed Dapr using __Helm 2.X__:

```bash
helm del --purge dapr
```

If you previously installed Dapr using __Helm 3.X__:

```bash
helm uninstall dapr -n dapr-system
```

Update the Dapr repo:

```bash
helm repo update
```

If you installed Dapr with Helm to a namespace other than `dapr-system`, modify the uninstall command above to account for that.

You can now follow [these](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr/#install-with-helm-advanced) instructions on how to install Dapr using __Helm 3__.

Alternatively, you can use the newer version of CLI:

```
dapr init --kubernetes
```

##### Post installation

Verify the control plane pods are running and are healthy:

```
$ dapr status -k

  NAME                   NAMESPACE    HEALTHY  STATUS   REPLICAS  VERSION  AGE  CREATED
  dapr-dashboard         dapr-system  True     Running  1         0.5.0    15s  2020-12-15 13:07.39
  dapr-sidecar-injector  dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.0.0   15s  2020-12-15 13:07.39
  dapr-sentry            dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.0.0   15s  2020-12-15 13:07.39
  dapr-operator          dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.0.0   15s  2020-12-15 13:07.39
  dapr-placement         dapr-system  True     Running  1         1.0.0   15s  2020-12-15 13:07.39
```

After Dapr 1.0.0 has been installed, perform a rolling restart for your deployments to pick up the new version of the sidecar.
This can be done with:

```
kubectl rollout restart deploy/<deployment-name>
```
