# Integration with Orleans

[Orleans](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans) is a framework for building distributed high-scale applications. It implements the [Virtual Actors model](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/orleans-distributed-virtual-actors-for-programmability-and-scalability/?from=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fapps%2Fpubs%2Fdefault.aspx%3Fid%3D210931) for cloud applications. The Actions team has been collaborating with the Orleans team to bring the two together. The integration brings benefits to both Orleans developers and Actions developers:

* Developers can use strongly typed Orleans programming models on top of Actions runtime. And with the separation of programming experience and runtime, Orleans is poised for supporting more programming languages.
* Developers can easily orchestrate Orleans services with other service such as containerized services, managed cloud services and functions to form comprehensive applications.
* Developers can leverage Orleans runtime features using the standard Actions API without writing Orleans-specific code.

## Overview
To enable this integration, Orleans binary is split into two parts: a **typed library** to deliver developer experience, and a **runtime library** that operates the Orleans entity mesh. The Orleans typed library interacts with Actions RPC (HTTP or gRPC) API to integrate with Actions system. 

Actions defines an **Actor API** that encapsulates Actions' interaction with an Actor Framework. In this case, Actions RPC API talks to an Orleans Actor API implementation that allows Actions to invoke Orleansâ€™ native entities.

The overall archiecture is illustrated by the following diagram:

The architecture supports multiple integration paths:

* Blue route: End-to-end Orleans experience with full-featured Orleans SDK and runtime. Users can then configure integration with other services such as Functions and Logic Apps through Actions.

* Green route: Orleans programming experience on top of Actions. 

* Yellow route: Actions code taking advantage of Orleans runtime.

* Dotted route: If the developer chose to, she can directly call Orleans Actor API from her Actions code as well. This saves a hop through Actions.
